This file is a placeholder. To ensure proper PWA home-screen icons on Android and other platforms,
add PNG files to this folder with the following names and sizes:

- `icon-192.png` — 192x192 pixels (used for many Android home-screen tiles)
- `icon-512.png` — 512x512 pixels (used for Play Store / higher-resolution tiles)

Tips:
- Export PNGs from `icon.svg` (recommended) using a graphics tool or `rsvg-convert`/`inkscape`/Figma.
- Place the PNG files here and restore or add PNG entries to `public/manifest.json` if you prefer raster icons.

Note: The manifest currently references `icon.svg` and `favicon.svg` as fallbacks, but some platforms
(especially older Android versions) require PNG images for proper home-screen icons.
