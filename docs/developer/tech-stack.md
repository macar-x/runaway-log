## Deployment

### Containerization

- **Docker** - Containerization platform
  - Packages the application and its dependencies into containers
  - Consistent environment across development, testing, and production
  - Simplified deployment process

### Docker Compose

- **Docker Compose** - Tool for defining and running multi-container Docker applications
  - Single YAML file to configure all services
  - Easy to start and stop the entire application stack
  - Supports environment-specific configurations

### Web Server
