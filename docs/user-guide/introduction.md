# Introduction to RunawayLog

Welcome to RunawayLog! This document will help you understand what RunawayLog is, why you might want to use it, and how it can benefit your daily life.

## What is RunawayLog?

RunawayLog is a simple, privacy-focused web application that helps you track your desire to escape the daily grind. Every time you click the "Run" button, it records a "hit" representing your dream of breaking free from routine.

The app visualizes these hits in a beautiful calendar heatmap, similar to GitHub's contribution graph, allowing you to see patterns in your desire to escape over time.

## Why Use RunawayLog?

### 1. Awareness and Self-Reflection

By tracking when you feel the urge to escape, you gain valuable insights into your work-life balance. You might discover patterns like:
- Feeling overwhelmed during certain days of the week
- Experiencing more escape thoughts during specific projects or meetings
- Noticing seasonal trends in your motivation

### 2. Motivation and Inspiration

RunawayLog provides motivational quotes with every click, giving you a little boost when you need it most. These quotes remind you that you're not alone in feeling this way and that better days are ahead.

### 3. Privacy-First Design

Unlike many tracking apps, RunawayLog stores all your data locally in your browser's localStorage. This means:
- Your data never leaves your device
- You don't need to create an account
- There's no risk of your personal information being compromised

### 4. Beautiful Visualization

The calendar heatmap transforms your escape thoughts into a colorful visualization, making it easy to see your progress and patterns at a glance.

### 5. Progressive Web App (PWA)

RunawayLog is a Progressive Web App, which means:
- You can install it on your device like a native app
- It works offline
- It's responsive and looks great on all screen sizes

## Who is RunawayLog For?

RunawayLog is for anyone who:
- Feels stuck in a daily routine
- Wants to better understand their work-life balance
- Enjoys visualizing data and seeing patterns
- Values privacy and data ownership
- Needs a little motivation boost from time to time

Whether you're a student, professional, freelancer, or anyone else dealing with daily responsibilities, RunawayLog can help you gain insights into your desire for freedom.
